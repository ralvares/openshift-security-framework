## Why This Project?

I‚Äôve built an OpenShift Security Enablement Framework‚Äîa structured, role-based approach to help teams understand what security looks like in practice, not just in theory. It maps common roles (like Developers, Platform Engineers, Architects, and more) to clear responsibilities and skills, from basic to advanced levels.

The goal is to:
- Simplify conversations about OpenShift security.
- Help align expectations early (before jumping straight into ACS).
- Enable everyone ‚Äî from sales to delivery ‚Äî to talk about value, not just features.
- Provide a foundation for training, workshops, and customer enablement.

If you‚Äôre working with customers who struggle to understand where ACS fits, or are comparing it to ‚Äúall-in-one‚Äù security tools, this framework can help reset the conversation and clarify what OpenShift secures by design, and where ACS adds value.

**Your feedback is invaluable!**

**If this framework resonates with you or sparks ideas, let‚Äôs connect and explore ways to collaborate!**

# OpenShift Security Role-Based Skills Framework

The **OpenShift Security Role-Based Skills Framework** is a structured, dynamic model that maps Kubernetes/OpenShift security concepts to key technical personas within an organization. It empowers teams by aligning daily responsibilities with actionable security skills, tailored by role and maturity level‚Äîfrom foundational knowledge to advanced leadership.

---

## Purpose

This framework helps organizations:
- Translate OpenShift/Kubernetes security capabilities into practical, role-specific learning paths.
- Enable tailored upskilling for developers, platform engineers, architects, security teams, and compliance officers.
- Drive adoption of Red Hat OpenShift‚Äôs built-in and extended security features (like RHACS, Compliance Operator, audit logs).
- Bridge the gap between security requirements and day-to-day platform operations or app development.

---

## How It Works

The framework is structured into three key layers:

### 1. Skills Library
A reusable set of security skills, each mapped to OpenShift-native capabilities (e.g., SCCs, RBAC, audit logs). Skills are grouped by:
- **Basic:** Foundational knowledge (e.g., shared responsibility, OWASP Top 10)
- **Intermediate:** Integration and operationalization (e.g., CI/CD pipelines, incident response)
- **Advanced:** Leadership, policy creation, automation

### 2. Responsibilities
Common day-to-day actions or duties per role, such as maintaining CI/CD pipelines or enforcing security controls, reused across multiple roles to avoid duplication.

### 3. Role Mapping
Each role includes:
- A short description
- A list of associated responsibilities (linked by ID)
- Skill expectations by level (Basic, Intermediate, Advanced)

---

## Who It‚Äôs For

This framework is tailored for multiple roles involved in the software delivery and security lifecycle, including:
- **Application Developers**
- **Software Developers**
- **Infrastructure Engineers**
- **Security Architects**
- **DevSecOps Engineers**
- **Network Engineers**
- **Security Engineers**
- **Security Operations Specialists**

Each role is mapped to relevant responsibilities and skill levels.

---

## Features

- **Interactive Role Selection:** Select one or more roles to view their descriptions, core responsibilities, and mapped skills by level.
- **Reusable Skills & Responsibilities:** Skills and responsibilities are referenced by ID, making the system DRY and scalable.
- **Extensible:** Add new roles, skills, or responsibilities by updating the JSON and Markdown files.
- **Sales & Learning Ready:** Use for onboarding, capability assessment, training plans, or to explain the business value of OpenShift Security to different teams.

## Roles at a Glance (Current Canonical Set)

Below is the concise intent of each role after applying the ‚Äúcleaner ownership‚Äù model (reduced overlap, clearer accountability). Overlaps that remain are intentional for hand‚Äëoff points.

### Application Developer
Purpose: Build and ship secure workloads; integrate day‚Äëone security hygiene (least privilege, proper secret handling, secure and reproducible image construction).
Core Responsibilities:
- Perform lightweight threat modeling for applications and workloads.
- Implement role and service account access controls.
- Use and reference secrets safely; enable encryption features where appropriate.
- Integrate security scanning and testing into the build pipeline.
- Keep dependencies and base images current.
- Apply platform-recommended security posture in workloads (non-root, resource limits, network scoping, minimal base images).
- Collaborate on interpreting audit and application logs for security signals.
- Produce minimal, secure, reproducible container images and apply basic image signing.
Out of Scope: Designing platform governance, tuning runtime detection systems, or managing security policy exceptions (kept out to reduce cognitive load).  
Advanced Scope: Intentionally none‚Äîadvanced responsibilities shift to DevSecOps or Architecture as a growth path.

### Platform Operator
Purpose: Operate, harden, and maintain compliant OpenShift clusters; enforce day‚Äëto‚Äëday platform guardrails.
Core Responsibilities:
- Configure pod security, role-based access, and baseline network segmentation policies.
- Harden and patch nodes and core cluster components.
- Aggregate and forward audit logs to enterprise logging and analytics.
- Run vulnerability scans on platform-scoped images and remediate findings.
- Automate compliance scanning and interpret/remediate results.
- Embed baseline guardrails into shared build/deploy flows (with DevSecOps collaboration).
- Provide security-oriented platform documentation and training.
- Maintain authoritative written security standards and policy documents.
- Define and manage resource quotas, limits, and guardrails.
- Execute operational secret rotation and integration tasks.
Advanced (limited): Participate in governance, build automation/remediation workflows, enable consumers‚Äîwithout designing multi‚Äëcluster or identity architecture (handled by Architecture).

### DevSecOps Engineer
Purpose: Embed security in delivery workflows; enforce policy gates; provide feedback loops from runtime back to build; own software supply chain control execution.
Core Responsibilities:
- Build and evolve secure CI/CD pipelines.
- Secure infrastructure-as-code and deployment automation artifacts.
- Implement and maintain admission and related policy enforcement controllers.
- Facilitate collaborative threat modeling and feed outcomes into runtime monitoring and incident response playbooks.
- Implement workload isolation and zero trust patterns in delivery workflows.
- Operate artifact signing and attestation verification gates.
- Tune runtime detection rules and telemetry to improve signal quality.
- Feed production security learnings back into build, test, and release processes.
Boundary: Does not govern formal policy exceptions or manage platform quotas and secret rotation‚Äîthose sit with Architecture and Platform respectively.

### Security Architect
Purpose: Define platform-wide security strategy: governance, multi‚Äëcluster posture, identity architecture, and exception lifecycle.
Core Responsibilities:
- Provide architectural patterns for secure platform deployment and evolution.
- Lead governance and zero trust policy definition.
- Guide automation strategy for vulnerability assessment and assurance workflows.
- Mentor and uplift teams‚Äô security maturity.
- Define advanced policy constructs and admission control strategy.
- Curate and align the portfolio of security infrastructure (identity, logging/analytics, runtime security, policy engines).
- Align security roadmaps with product and delivery goals.
- Orchestrate multi‚Äëcluster security and compliance policy propagation.
- Govern security control exceptions (criteria, approval, expiration, review).
- Design and oversee workload identity and trust issuance.
- Ensure workload-level best practices are reflected in platform standards (without owning daily execution).
Excluded Operational Tasks: Routine secret rotations, quota management, and hands‚Äëon operation of supply chain enforcement gates‚Äîdelegated to Platform and DevSecOps.

### Network & Infrastructure Engineer (Specialized / Optional)
Purpose: Engineer the secure data plane: segmentation strategy, encryption patterns, trust fabric, identity‚Äëaware routing, and traffic anomaly detection foundations.
Core Responsibilities:
- Design and implement advanced network segmentation, ingress, and egress governance boundaries.
- Implement encryption for data in transit and at rest according to organizational standards.
- Monitor for and help mitigate anomalous or denial‚Äëstyle traffic patterns.
- Contribute to multi‚Äëcluster security and compliance posture from the network perspective.
- Implement runtime workload and service identity trust integration.
- Engineer the service‚Äëto‚Äëservice trust fabric (identity exchange, mutual TLS layering, certificate/key lifecycle automation).
Not Owning: Compliance scanning automation, supply chain validation gates, or organization‚Äëwide artifact provenance governance‚Äîthose remain with Platform, DevSecOps, and Architecture.

## Skill Interpretation

Skills are grouped by difficulty/impact, not years of experience.

| Tier | Meaning | Typical Output Examples |
|------|---------|-------------------------|
| Basic | Knows concepts & safely uses them | Non-root image, baseline NetworkPolicy, uses Secrets properly |
| Intermediate | Integrates & adapts controls | Adds scanning to pipeline, rotates secrets, builds reproducible images |
| Advanced | Designs strategy / automation / governance | Multi-cluster policy blueprint, exception workflow, identity trust fabric |

Each role‚Äôs `skills` object lists only the skills expected *for that role*. Absence of a skill does not mean the persona could not learn it‚Äîjust that it is not baseline for the role.

---

## Reading `mapping.json`

Top-level keys:
1. `skills`: Canonical skill catalog (`<ID>` ‚Üí { desc, relevance }).  
2. `responsibilities`: Canonical duties (`R#` ‚Üí description).  
3. `roles`: Each persona with `description`, `responsibilities` (array of IDs), and tiered `skills`.  

To display a role:
1. Look up its responsibility IDs and render descriptions.  
2. Render Basic ‚Üí Intermediate ‚Üí Advanced skill sets in order.  
3. (Optional) Derive coverage: For any responsibility requiring a skill outside the role‚Äôs lists, flag a potential gap (this framework intentionally trimmed such mismatches in the ‚Äúcleaner ownership‚Äù pass).  

---

## Cleaner Ownership Principles Applied

1. **One primary executor per operational domain** (e.g., secret rotation ‚Üí Platform, supply chain gates ‚Üí DevSecOps).  
2. **Strategy distinct from execution** (Architect sets multi-cluster & identity patterns; Platform / Network implement).  
3. **Developers focus on secure creation** (no governance overhead; advanced culture coaching removed).  
4. **DevSecOps ‚â† Platform**: DevSecOps owns pipeline, policy gating, and feedback loops‚Äînot day-to-day node or quota operations.  
5. **Network role optional**: Only retained where segmentation + trust fabric complexity justifies specialization.

---

## Typical Usage Scenarios

| Scenario | How to Use the Framework |
|----------|--------------------------|
| New customer/platform assessment | Map current staff to roles ‚Üí highlight missing responsibilities |
| Training plan creation | For each role list missing intermediate skills ‚Üí build targeted workshops |
| Tool justification (e.g. runtime security) | Show which responsibilities require tuning (R33, R25) and which role owns them |
| Scope creep control | Reject additions that assign execution + governance to the same role |
| Hiring | Translate unowned responsibilities into a candidate profile |

---

## Extending the Framework

1. Add a new responsibility in `responsibilities` with next free ID (avoid reusing IDs).  
2. Only then assign it to exactly one primary role (add secondary later if absolutely needed).  
3. If the responsibility implies a capability not described, add a new skill ID (choose tier by impact).  
4. Re-run a quick consistency check manually: every role responsibility should map conceptually to at least one of its skill tiers.  
5. Keep Advanced additions scarce to preserve clear progression.

Naming guidance:
- Responsibilities = Outcome phrased verb-first, single focus.  
- Skills = Capability statements (what the person *can do*), with relevance kept vendor-neutral.  

---

## Example: Gap Analysis Walkthrough

Goal: ‚ÄúDo we have coverage for designing and issuing workload identities and related trust policies?‚Äù  
1. Locate the responsibility description for workload identity and trust design in the reference table.  
2. Primary owners here: Security Architect and (where present) Network & Infrastructure Engineer.  
3. If neither role exists, decide whether to expand the Platform Operator‚Äôs remit (adding advanced identity design capability) or introduce a specialized role.  
4. Confirm that advanced identity / trust architecture expertise actually exists before assigning ownership.  
Outcome: Clear staffing or enablement decision.

---

## Why Some Advanced Skills Are Absent in Certain Roles

When an advanced capability is missing from a role, that is intentional‚Äîit protects focus and keeps cognitive load manageable. For example, application developers absolutely contribute to producing secure, minimal, reproducible container images and to adopting supply‚Äëchain good practices inside their build process. However, they are not expected to design or operate the governance layer for software supply chain integrity (such as signing infrastructure, attestation validation, or organization‚Äëwide policy gates). Those activities sit with the DevSecOps function, which owns the operation and enforcement of build and deployment security controls. Developers consume the guardrails; DevSecOps engineers implement, integrate, and continually refine them.

## Feedback & Contribution

Open issues or PRs with:
- Proposed new responsibility (include justification + proposed primary owner)
- Skill clarifications or tier adjustments
- Real-world adoption feedback (what resonated / what was confusing)

Your input helps refine this into an industry-aligned reference rather than a single‚Äëperspective artifact.
