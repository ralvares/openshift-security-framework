The following CIS Safeguards were NOT mapped to NIST SP 800-53,,,,
3.12,Segment Data Processing and Storage Based on Sensitivity,Segment data processing and storage based on the sensitivity of the data. Do not process sensitive data on enterprise assets intended for lower sensitivity data.,,
12.8,Establish and Maintain Dedicated Computing Resources for All Administrative Work,"Establish and maintain dedicated computing resources, either physically or logically separated, for all administrative tasks or tasks requiring administrative access. The computing resources should be segmented from the enterprise's primary network and not be allowed internet access.",,
13.2,Deploy a Host-Based Intrusion Detection Solution,"Deploy a host-based intrusion detection solution on enterprise assets, where appropriate and/or supported.",,
13.7,Deploy a Host-Based Intrusion Prevention Solution," Deploy a host-based intrusion prevention solution on enterprise assets, where appropriate and/or supported. Example implementations include use of an Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) client or host-based IPS agent.",,
15.7,Securely Decommission Service Providers,Securely decommission service providers. Example considerations include user and service account deactivation; termination of data flows; and secure disposal of enterprise data within service provider systems.,,
16.8,Separate Production and Non-Production Systems,Maintain separate environments for production and non-production systems.,,
16.13,Conduct Application Penetration Testing,"Conduct application penetration testing. For critical applications, authenticated penetration testing is better suited to finding business logic vulnerabilities than code scanning and automated security testing. Penetration testing relies on the skill of the tester to manually manipulate an application as an authenticated and unauthenticated user. ",,
16.14,Conduct Threat Modeling,"Conduct threat modeling. Threat modeling is the process of identifying and addressing application security design flaws within a design, before code is created. It is conducted through specially trained individuals who evaluate the application design and gauge security risks for each entry point and access level. The goal is to map out the application, architecture, and infrastructure in a structured way to understand its weaknesses.",,
18.1,Establish and Maintain a Penetration Testing Program,"Establish and maintain a penetration testing program appropriate to the size, complexity, and maturity of the enterprise. Penetration testing program characteristics should include scope, such as network, web application, API, hosted services, and physical premise controls; frequency; limitations, such as acceptable hours, and excluded attack types; point of contact information; remediation, such as how findings will be routed internally; and, retrospective requirements.",,
18.2,Perform Periodic External Penetration Tests,"Perform periodic external penetration tests based on program requirements, but no less than annually. External penetration testing should include enterprise and environmental reconnaissance to detect exploitable information. Penetration testing requires specialized skills and experience and must be conducted by a qualified party. The testing may be clear box or opaque box. See the Cloud Companion Guide for cloud-specific guidance.",,
18.3,Remediate Penetration Test Findings,Remediate penetration test findings based on the enterprise’s policy for remediation scope and prioritization.,,
18.4,Validate Security Measures,Validate security measures after each penetration test. Enterprises should modify rulesets and capabilities to detect the techniques used by testers.,,
18.5,Perform Periodic Internal Penetration Tests,"Perform periodic internal penetration tests based on program requirements, but no less than annually. The testing may be clear box or opaque box. See the Cloud Companion Guide for cloud-specific guidance.",,
