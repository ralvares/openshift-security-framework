== 8. Summary

This onboarding playbook provides a consistent, secure operational model by combining:

- a strict perimeter enforced by a small suite of AdminNetworkPolicies (DNS, kube-API, monitoring, corporate egress, default deny)
- developer autonomy inside safe boundaries
- clear separation of responsibilities
- predictable ingress and egress controls
- standardized onboarding workflow across the organization

It guarantees that application teams can innovate quickly without exposing the platform to security or compliance risks.
