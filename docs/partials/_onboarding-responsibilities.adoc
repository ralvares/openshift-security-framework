== 4. Developer Responsibilities

Developers own:

- Application-level NetworkPolicies (pod-level ingress/egress)
- Service definitions and routing rules
- Pod labels/selectors inside their namespace
- Ensuring their NetworkPolicies do not unintentionally block required traffic
- Testing internal connectivity

They do not manage:

- kube-API access (requires Security approval and ANP)
- Monitoring ingress (requires Security/Platform approval and ANP)
- Perimeter egress settings (DNS, corporate networks, default deny)
- Namespace labels


== 5. Security Team Responsibilities

Security owns:

- Enforcing namespace perimeter via AdminNetworkPolicies and BANP
- Approving kube-API and monitoring ingress exceptions
- Managing and reviewing AdminNetworkPolicy configuration
- Reviewing external requirements and compliance
- Ensuring compliance with corporate and regulatory standards


== 6. Platform Team Responsibilities

Platform owns:

- Namespace creation (templates, labels, quotas)
- Initial scaffolding (default policies, RBAC, limits)
- Maintaining cluster networking configuration
- Ensuring namespaces consistently inherit baseline security controls (including BANP)
- Enforcing that developers cannot modify protected namespace labels
