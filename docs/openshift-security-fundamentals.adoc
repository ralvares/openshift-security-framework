== 1. Defense in Depth

=== What It Means
Relying on a single control is risky. Software has flaws; people make mistakes. Layer safeguards so one failure degrades—not destroys—posture.

=== Storytelling Example
A deserialization flaw lets an attacker drop a crypto‑miner into one pod. Attempts: privilege escalation (host mount), list pods in finance/prod, lateral service probing. SCC denies privilege escalation, NetworkPolicies drop cross-namespace probes, RBAC denies API calls. Impact contained to transient CPU burn.

=== How OpenShift Helps
SCCs/PSA restrict escalation; NetworkPolicies segment traffic.

=== Organizational Value
Reduces catastrophic failure probability, lowers incident blast radius, supports resilience & regulatory expectations.

== 2. Secure by Design

=== What It Means
Bake security into architecture: image-based hosts (RHCOS), signed releases, declarative reconciliation. Design prevents entire classes of failure before operations.

=== Storytelling Example
Hotfix via SSH modifies a systemd unit and disables update timer. MCO flags drift; node marked degraded. Team reverts via MachineConfig—change gains provenance & reversibility.

=== How OpenShift Helps
Signed RHCOS + Machine Config / Cluster Version Operators enforce intended state & provenance.

=== Organizational Value
Integrity lowers audit friction, speeds patch adoption, reduces time to restore trust.

== 3. Secure by Default

=== What It Means
Out-of-the-box posture blocks high-risk patterns (root, privileged pods, unsafe syscalls) so new teams don't unknowingly deploy danger.

=== Storytelling Example
Log4Shell exploit lands code execution, but random non-root UID, default seccomp, and restricted egress neuter lateral & exfil attempts until rebuild.

=== How OpenShift Helps
Restricted SCC + default seccomp limit abuse pre-custom policy.

=== Organizational Value
Shrinks initial attack window; reduces onboarding risk and review backlog.

== 4. Separation of Duty

=== What It Means
Critical changes require distinct proposer, reviewer, applier. Segregation catches mistakes and deters insider misuse.

=== Storytelling Example
MR wants unvetted personal registry image (mutable tag, unsinged). Reviewer rejects; RBAC + GitOps prevent direct live mutation. Unsafe image never deploys.

=== How OpenShift Helps
RBAC scopes verbs; operators reconcile only approved, versioned configs.

=== Organizational Value
Creates audit trails, satisfies governance (e.g., SOX), limits impact of compromised credentials.

== 5. Least Privilege

=== What It Means
Grant only required permissions, capabilities, network paths, resources. Minimize authority to constrain blast radius.

=== Storytelling Example
Leaked CI token attempts secret list (403), privileged pod creation (denied), external curl (egress blocked). Containment triggers anomaly alerts quickly.

=== How OpenShift Helps
RBAC + SCC/PSA + NetworkPolicies curb horizontal and vertical escalation.

=== Organizational Value
Reduces regulatory exposure, narrows exfil paths, lowers incident response cost.

== 6. Transparency

=== What It Means
Observability + signed artifacts replace guesswork with evidence.

=== Storytelling Example
OpenSSL CVE appears. Query SBOM + Quay manifests for vulnerable digests, patch base, rebuild dependents, produce evidence list same day.

=== How OpenShift Helps
Signed images, SBOM + VEX data, audit logs, upgrade provenance.

=== Organizational Value
Accelerates patch SLAs, strengthens trust, simplifies compliance evidence.

== 7. Understand the Threat

=== What It Means
Focus on realistic attacker behavior (lateral movement, escalation, exfil). Detect early, mitigate precisely.

=== Storytelling Example
RCE exploited; attacker probes internal services, API, tokens, outbound channels. Audit + ACS detect reconnaissance; segmentation & least privilege block pivots; patched image rolls out swiftly.

=== How OpenShift Helps
Foundational visibility (audit, events) + enforcement (RBAC, SCC, NetPol) + ACS deep scanning & behavioral analytics.

=== Organizational Value
Earlier detection shortens dwell time and reduces impact.

== Closing Message
Security strength emerges from deliberate layering: signed foundations, enforced runtime constraints, scoped authority, segmented networks, and runtime behavioral insight (native audit + ACS analytics). These complementary capabilities shift teams from reactive hardening to proactive, evidence-backed resilience—reducing risk while sustaining delivery speed.
