= RHACS Internal Entities

Internal Entities are things you can see in the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (RHACS) network graph.

**What Internal Entities Mean**

* An Internal Entity shows a connection between a deployment and an IP address that belongs to the private address space (like the one defined in RFC 1918).

* When RHACS shows traffic involving an Internal Entity, it is essentially saying: "We cannot find the specific deployment(s) involved, but don’t worry, that traffic is not leaving the cluster".

**When Internal Entities Show Up**

The sources list several situations that can cause Internal Entities to appear on the network graph:

* When a deployment is communicating with the orchestrator API.
* When a deployment communicates using a networking Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin.
* When a deployment (acting as the server) is deleted or its IP address changes while the client trying to connect to it is still running.
* If the Sensor restarts, it can reset the mapping of IP addresses to deployments. This means the Sensor doesn't recognize the IP addresses of past or existing entities, causing them to appear as Internal Entities.

In Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (RHACS), an **Internal Entity** refers to a network endpoint that is part of the cluster's internal network infrastructure but is not managed directly by the Kubernetes orchestrator (e.g., not a Deployment, DaemonSet, or StatefulSet).

These entities typically use IP addresses from the private address space defined in **RFC 1918** (e.g., `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`), which are reserved for private networks and not routable on the global internet.

== Static Pods and Infrastructure Components

A common example of internal entities in an OpenShift cluster are the critical control plane components. Services such as `etcd`, `kube-apiserver`, `kube-controller-manager`, and `kube-scheduler` often run as **static pods**.

Unlike standard application workloads, static pods are:

* Not managed by Kubernetes controllers (like Deployments).
* Started directly by the `kubelet` daemon on each node.
* Defined by static configuration files located in `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/` on control-plane nodes.

You can identify these static pods in your cluster by checking for the `kubernetes.io/config.source` annotation. For example:

[source,bash]
----
oc get pods -A -o json | jq -r '.items[] | select(.metadata.annotations."kubernetes.io/config.source" == "file") | [.metadata.namespace,.metadata.name] | @tsv'
----

== Understanding Internal Entities in the Network Graph

Internal Entities are elements you can visualize in the RHACS network graph.

=== What Internal Entities Mean

* **Private Network Connection**: An Internal Entity represents a connection between a deployment and an IP address that belongs to the private address space (as defined in RFC 1918).
* **Unidentified Deployment**: When RHACS displays traffic involving an Internal Entity, it essentially means: "We cannot identify the specific deployment(s) involved, but the traffic is confirmed to be staying within the cluster."

=== When Internal Entities Show Up

There are several common situations that cause Internal Entities to appear on the network graph:

* **Orchestrator API Communication**: When a deployment communicates with the Kubernetes/OpenShift API server (often hosted on static pods).
* **CNI Plugin Traffic**: When a deployment communicates using a networking Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin, like Calico, which might use internal IPs for control traffic.
* **Transient or Deleted Workloads**: When a deployment (acting as a server) is deleted or its IP address changes while a client is still trying to connect to it.
* **Sensor Restarts**: If the RHACS Sensor restarts, it may reset its mapping of IP addresses to deployments. This can cause existing connections to be temporarily unrecognized and labeled as Internal Entities until the mapping is rebuilt.

== Example: Accessing the Kubernetes API

A practical example of this behavior is observed when pods communicate with the Kubernetes API server. In every OpenShift cluster, there is a default service named `kubernetes` in the `default` namespace that provides a stable entry point for the API.

[source,bash]
----
oc describe service kubernetes -n default

.Sample Output
[source,yaml]

Name:                     kubernetes
Namespace:                default
Labels:                   component=apiserver
                          provider=kubernetes
Annotations:              <none>
Selector:                 <none>
Type:                     ClusterIP
IP Family Policy:         SingleStack
IP Families:              IPv4
IP:                       172.30.0.1
IPs:                      172.30.0.1
Port:                     https  443/TCP
TargetPort:               6443/TCP
Endpoints:                192.168.50.10:6443,192.168.50.11:6443,192.168.50.12:6443
Session Affinity:         None
Internal Traffic Policy:  Cluster
Events:                   <none>
----

Notice the **Endpoints** field: `192.168.50.10:6443, 192.168.50.11:6443, ...`. These IP addresses correspond to the control plane nodes where the `kube-apiserver` static pods are running.

When a pod in your cluster (e.g., an Operator or a custom controller) makes a request to the Kubernetes API, the traffic is routed to one of these endpoints. Since these endpoints are hosted by static pods (which are not managed by a Deployment) and use private IPs, RHACS identifies the destination as an **Internal Entity**.

This is why you might see connections from your workloads to "Internal Entities" in the Network Graph, representing legitimate communication with the Kubernetes control plane.
