== Skill
Map how OpenShift security add-ons combine for scanning, hardening, detection, and compliance evidence.

== Objective
* Identify component roles
* Run (or simulate) a benchmark scan
* Discover SPO runtime hardening options
* Place RHACS across build→runtime

== Why it Matters
Platform defaults are locks & walls; add-ons become cameras, inspectors, detectors, and auto-remediators—shrinking time-to-detect and audit friction.

== What it Solves
* Manual ad hoc audit prep
* Inconsistent seccomp/SELinux usage
* Late discovery of vulnerable images
* Missed lateral or API misuse

|===
|Component | Primary Focus | Analogy | Outcome
|Compliance Operator | Benchmark scanning & remediation | Building inspector | Evidence-backed posture
|Security Profiles Operator (SPO) | Seccomp/SELinux profile lifecycle | Tailored safety harness | Minimal syscall set
|RHACS | Image + runtime + network security | Security operations center | Policy-driven gating & detection
|SCC / PSA | Admission privilege guardrails | Door lock policies | Unsafe specs blocked
|GitOps (Argo CD) | Drift & desired state | Blueprint repository | Trustworthy change trail
|===

== How to Secure (Lifecycle View)
* Build: RHACS scan + policy score gates; SPO profile recording.
* Registry: Signed & scanned images (Quay+RHACS).
* Deploy: SCC/PSA + admission policies; scheduled Compliance scans.
* Runtime: RHACS anomaly + network; SPO enforced profiles.

== How to Try It (Exploration)

.Compliance Operator presence
[source,sh]
----
oc get pods -n openshift-compliance 2>/dev/null || echo 'Compliance Operator not installed'
----
.List profiles
[source,sh]
----
oc get profiles.compliance.openshift.io -A 2>/dev/null || true
----
.Sample scan (adjust names if exist)
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: ComplianceSuite
metadata:
  name: cis-scan
spec:
  schedule: "0 1 * * *"
  scans:
  - name: cis
    profile: rhcos4-moderate
    content: rhcos4
    scanType: Platform
----

.View results later
[source,sh]
----
oc get compliancecheckresults.compliance.openshift.io | head

NOTE: SPO manages recording & enforcing seccomp / SELinux profiles; deeper commands appear in advanced labs.

== Solutions / Controls
* Continuous scanning & remediation
* Hardened runtime via seccomp/SELinux
* Policy gates pre-runtime
* Drift detection with GitOps
* Correlated analytics (process, network, API)

|Goal | Tooling | Business Benefit
|Regulatory Evidence | Compliance Operator | Faster audits
|Syscall Least Privilege | SPO | Reduced kernel surface
|Vulnerability Gate | RHACS + Quay | Blocks known-bad deploys
|Privilege Enforcement | SCC/PSA | Fewer escalation paths
|Change Traceability | GitOps | Accountability & rollback clarity

== FAQs
Do I need everything day one?:: Start with RBAC/SCC/NetworkPolicies; add scanning & compliance iteratively.
How do SPO profiles get created?:: Recorded baselines or curated templates.
Difference between Compliance vs RHACS scan?:: Benchmark config vs image/runtime risk & behavior.
Are scans disruptive?:: Low-impact; schedule off-peak for large estates.

== Closing Story
The cluster is a campus: locks (SCC), guards (RHACS), inspectors (Compliance), custom gear (SPO). Overlapping layers prevent single-point failure.

== Next Step Ideas
* Weekly scan diff reporting
* Enforce signed images only (cosign + admission)
* Gradual seccomp rollout starting with low-risk apps
