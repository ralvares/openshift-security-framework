== Overview

These basic labs are a hands-on introduction to OpenShift’s secure-by-default posture. You’ll see how to run apps without weakening the platform by aligning workloads to built-in guardrails instead of bypassing them.

Built-in capabilities covered (where to see them):

- Least privilege by default (restricted SCC/PSA: non-root, drop caps, high ports) - B1, B3
- RBAC tiers (view/edit/admin) and impersonation - B2
- Network segmentation (NetworkPolicies) - B4
- Secret management (env vs file mounts; rotation behavior) - B5
- Image provenance gates (allow-listed registries, admission policies) - B6
- API audit trails (exec/port-forward forensics) - B7
- Secure-by-design images (UBI, non-root, high ports) - B9
- Transport security on routes (TLS with redirect) - B10
- Resource controls (LimitRange + ResourceQuota) - B3B

What you’ll practice:

- Deploy something that “worked on a laptop” and learn why guardrails block it
- Fix the workload (not the platform) to run non-root on high ports
- Limit who can do what with built-in RBAC roles
- Lock down pod-to-pod traffic with default deny + target allows
- Use Secrets properly and understand rotation trade-offs
- Enforce trusted registries and verify image digests
- Query audit logs to answer who/what/when/where
- Rebuild images to pass restricted SCC without exceptions
- Force HTTPS on app routes

Audience and prerequisites:

- OpenShift Local or Red Hat OpenShift cluster
- For platform admins, app teams, and security engineers
- Requires oc CLI and a sandbox namespace; most labs need only project-level access
- Cluster-admin (or delegated) is needed for specific steps: B3’s anyuid exercise, B6’s admission policies
