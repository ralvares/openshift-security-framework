== Skill
Understand risk of unvetted registry images and enforce a trusted-source allow‑list in OpenShift.

== Objective

* Attempt deployment from unvetted source
* Observe deny under allow‑list
* Deploy trusted Red Hat UBI image
* Verify provenance (host + digest)

== Why it Matters
Unknown registry images are like unlabeled packages at a loading dock. Allow‑lists enforce provenance and reduce CVE noise.

== What it Solves

* Accidental pulls from arbitrary public defaults
* Image provenance ambiguity
* Higher vulnerability noise baseline
* Reproducibility issues with `:latest`

|===
|Area | Risk If Ignored | Analogy
|Unknown Registry Source | Malware / outdated libs | Unlabeled box left at dock
|Unmaintained Base Image | CVE accumulation | Expired fire extinguisher
|Implicit Tag (:latest) | Version drift | Moving target marker
|No Allow-List Policy | Anything enters prod | Unlocked side entrance
|Mixed Provenance Namespace | Hard incident scoping | Scrap + certified parts mixed
|Direct External Pull | Outage / tampering risk | Single fragile bridge
|Missing Signature / SBOM | Weak chain of custody | Broken package seal
|===

== How to Try It

.Create & label project
[source,sh]
----
oc new-project b6-trusted
oc label namespace b6-trusted trusted-registry-enforce=true --overwrite
----

.Apply namespace-scoped allow‑list (cluster-admin)
[source,yaml]
----

  validationActions: ["Deny"]

----

.Attempt disallowed image (expect deny)
[source,sh]
----
oc -n b6-trusted create deployment bad --image=docker.io/library/nginx:latest || true
----

.Deploy trusted UBI image (should succeed)
[source,sh]
----
oc -n b6-trusted create deployment good --image=registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi:latest -- sleep infinity
oc -n b6-trusted wait --for=condition=Available deployment/good --timeout=60s
----

.Verify provenance
[source,sh]
----
oc -n b6-trusted describe pod -l app=good | grep -E 'Image:|Image ID:'
oc -n b6-trusted get deployment good -o yaml | grep -i 'image:'
----

.Cleanup (optional)
[source,sh]
----
oc delete project b6-trusted --wait=false
oc delete validatingadmissionpolicybinding trusted-images-only-pods || true
oc delete validatingadmissionpolicybinding trusted-images-only-deployments || true
oc delete validatingadmissionpolicy allow-trusted-registries-pods || true
oc delete validatingadmissionpolicy allow-trusted-registries-deployments || true

== Summary Table
[cols="1,2,2,2",options="header"]
|===
|Aspect | DockerHub nginx:latest (Blocked) | Red Hat UBI (Allowed) | Quay.io Org Image (Allowed)
|Provenance | Unknown | Certified & curated | Org-governed
|Patch Cadence | Unclear | Documented errata | Varies

== FAQs
Why block DockerHub?:: Default registry fallback; weaker provenance guarantees.
Can I still use public images?:: Mirror/import them into a trusted registry first.
How to add another internal registry?:: Extend the CEL expression with another `startsWith`.
Why namespace label scoping?:: Progressive opt-in reduces outage risk.

== Appendix: Control Mapping Detail (CIS ↔ MITRE)

Only CIS 5.5.1 (image provenance & policy) is asserted.

[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
|Aspect | Explanation
|Primary CIS Control (5.5.1) | Demonstrated by admission denial of unapproved registry image and success of trusted UBI; provenance (image + digest) verified post-admission.
|ATT&CK Technique | T1195 (Supply Chain Compromise) – reducing ingress of unvetted artifacts.
|Mitigation | M1016 (Vulnerability / Patch Management) by gating to curated, maintained sources.
|Observed Evidence | Denied nginx pull; allowed UBI deployment; describe output shows registry + digest.
|Learner Outcome | Implement allow‑list policies rather than ad hoc manual reviews.
|Audit Use | Admission policy manifests + denied event + successful trusted deployment form traceable enforcement.
|===
Where does Lab B1 fit?:: B1 covers runtime least privilege; B6 covers image provenance.

== Closing Story
Trusted registries act like approved aerospace suppliers: origin is verified, not guessed.

== Next Step Ideas

* Extend policy to StatefulSets & DaemonSets
* Add warn-only binding for dev
* Integrate signature (cosign) verification
* Track denied attempts KPI
