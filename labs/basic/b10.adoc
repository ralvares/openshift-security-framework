== Skill
Secure application access with TLS, enforce HTTPS-only behavior, choose edge vs re-encrypt termination.

== Objective

* Expose over HTTP
* Add TLS (edge) + redirect
* Validate HTTPS & cert
* Understand re-encrypt vs passthrough

== Why it Matters
HTTP is a postcard; TLS is a sealed envelope. Encrypted transit preserves confidentiality and integrity.

== What it Solves

* Credential theft
* Session hijacking
* Compliance failures
* Undetectable tampering

== Understanding the Attack Surface
[cols="1,2,2",options="header"]
|===
|Area | Risk Without TLS | Mitigation
|Login Forms | Credential sniffing | HTTPS + redirect/HSTS
|API Payloads | Data manipulation | Integrity via TLS
|Session Cookies | Replay / theft | Secure + encrypted path
|Internal Service Calls | Lateral snooping | Re-encrypt/passthrough
|===

== How to Secure (Lifecycle View)
* Build: Avoid embedding secrets in query strings.
* Registry: Base images with current TLS libs.
* Deploy: Routes with TLS + redirect; manage cert rotation.
* Runtime: Monitor expiry & cipher posture.

== How to Try It
Prereq: LAB-B9 `b9-rebuild` project with `secure-app` exists.

.Switch project & get host
[source,sh]
----
oc project b9-rebuild
HOST=$(oc get route secure-app -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}' 2>/dev/null)
echo $HOST
----

.Baseline HTTP
[source,sh]
----
curl http://$HOST
----

.Replace route with HTTPS (edge + redirect)
[source,sh]
----
oc delete route secure-app
oc create route edge secure-app --service=secure-app --port=8080 --insecure-policy=Redirect
----

.Test HTTPS
[source,sh]
----
curl -k https://$HOST
----

.(Optional) Cleanup
[source,sh]
----
oc delete project b9-rebuild --wait=false
----

== Solutions / Controls

* Route TLS termination
* Redirect policy enforcement
* Re-encrypt mode for internal leg confidentiality
* Passthrough when app handles TLS (mTLS/SNI logic)
* Cert rotation automation

== Summary Table
[cols="1,2,2,2",options="header"]
|===
|Mode | Encrypts Client→Router | Encrypts Router→Pod | Use Case
|Edge | Yes | No | Simplicity; trusted internal network
|Re-encrypt | Yes | Yes (router re-issues) | Protect internal segment
|Passthrough | Yes (app terminates) | App handles | Custom protocols / mTLS end-to-end
|===

== FAQs
Is edge termination secure enough?:: Often yes for trusted internal networks; use re-encrypt if stricter confidentiality needed.
Why enforce redirect?:: Prevent accidental plaintext & downgrade attacks.
Manage cert renewals manually?:: Cluster certs rotate automatically; custom certs need process (e.g., cert-manager).
Re-encrypt vs passthrough difference?:: Re-encrypt terminates then re-establishes TLS; passthrough leaves TLS untouched to app.

== Closing Story
Enabling TLS + redirect is installing automatic door closers—connections don’t stay ajar.

== Next Step Ideas

* Deny non-TLS routes in prod via policy
* Implement HSTS headers
* Cert age monitoring & renewal alerts
