Perfect — that’s the exact flow we want to anchor the labs around 👏

This diagram nails the business logic, security posture, and teaching value all at once.
Let’s lock this as the canonical WeatherHub architecture for the beginner and intermediate labs.

Here’s a short executive-grade description you can use in docs, slides, or lab intros:

🌦 WeatherHub — Secure-by-Design Microservices Demo (Canonical Flow)

WeatherHub simulates a small SaaS platform designed around OpenShift’s built-in security layers.
Each namespace represents a different trust boundary, and every control (SCC, NetworkPolicy, JWT, RBAC) has an observable purpose.

🧩 End-to-End Data Flow
	1.	Public Weather API → Weather-Proxy (Go):
A Go sidecar fetches forecast data from the internet and saves it to an in-cluster file.
(Demonstrates trusted content, SCC restrictions, and non-root behavior.)
	2.	Weather-Proxy → Data-Syncer (Go):
The Data-Syncer runs internally, pulling sanitized weather JSON and pushing it into the API tier.
(Shows namespace isolation and least privilege via NetworkPolicies.)
	3.	Data-Syncer → API-Gateway (Go, JWT):
Gateway authenticates the syncer using a token read from environment or file.
(Introduces authentication, API keys, and RBAC logic.)
	4.	Gateway → Forecast API (FastAPI):
Forecast service performs CRUD operations backed by MySQL.
(Demonstrates serviceAccount scoping and secret management.)
	5.	Forecast API → MySQL (Shared DB):
All DB traffic flows only through internal services, never exposed.
(Reinforces data-plane isolation and encryption expectations.)
	6.	Frontend-App → Gateway:
User-facing application requests weather and analytics data securely using JWTs.
(Represents normal client → API pattern with token verification.)
	7.	Gateway → Vendor-Analytics (3rd Party):
Gateway aggregates external analytics data through a 3rd-party app that runs under an anyuid SCC,
annotated as a risk-accepted component for compliance evidence.

🔐 Security Layers Demonstrated

Layer	Purpose
SCC Enforcement	Differentiates trusted (restricted) vs. exception (anyuid) workloads
NetworkPolicies	Isolates traffic between namespaces
JWT / API Key Auth	Authenticates inter-service requests
ConfigMaps + Secrets	Centralized configuration and credential hygiene
UBI Images	Trusted content baseline
Audit & Risk Acceptance	Demonstrates compliance transparency

This flow allows every lab (B1–B5) to explore a single control in context:
	•	B1: Non-root enforcement (weather-proxy fails → fixed with UBI).
	•	B2: RBAC & least privilege (frontend vs. syncer permissions).
	•	B3: SCC exception with justification (vendor-analytics).
	•	B4: Network segmentation (deny cross-namespace except via gateway).
	•	B5: AuthZ via JWT (frontend and syncer tokens).

Would you like me to generate the namespace + deployment YAML templates (minimal but functional) for this full architecture next?
It’ll give you a base kubectl apply -f weatherhub.yaml to spin up the entire environment for the labs.
