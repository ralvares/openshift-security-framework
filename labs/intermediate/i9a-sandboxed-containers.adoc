== Skill
Advanced workload restriction (runtime isolation enhancements).

== Scenario
Untrusted or high-risk code (plugins, user uploads) should execute in stronger isolation. Sandboxed Containers (Kata) run pods inside lightweight VMs while retaining Kubernetes orchestration semantics.

== Objectives
* Verify / install Sandboxed Containers Operator
* Ensure `RuntimeClass` for kata exists
* Deploy standard vs kata pod and compare runtime isolation
* Confirm SCC + non-root still enforced

== Prerequisites
* Worker nodes with virtualization support (VT-x/AMD-V)
* Cluster admin permissions

== Operator Presence
```sh
oc get csv -n openshift-sandboxed-containers 2>/dev/null | grep -i sandbox || echo "Install Sandboxed Containers Operator from OperatorHub"
```

== RuntimeClass
```sh
oc get runtimeclass | grep -i kata || cat <<'EOF' | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: node.k8s.io/v1
kind: RuntimeClass
metadata:
  name: kata
handler: kata
EOF
```

== Namespace & Baseline Pod
```sh
oc new-project i9-sandbox
oc run regular --image=registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi -- sleep 3600
```

== Kata Pod
```sh
oc apply -f - <<'EOF'
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: kata-pod
spec:
  runtimeClassName: kata
  containers:
  - name: app
  image: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi
    command: ["sh","-c","uname -a; ps -ef; sleep 3600"]
EOF
```

== Compare Isolation
```sh
oc exec regular -- ps -ef | head
oc exec kata-pod -- ps -ef | head
```
Kata pod process list should show fewer host processes; underlying hypervisor isolation applies.

Check SCC annotation:
```sh
oc get pod kata-pod -o jsonpath='{.metadata.annotations.openshift\.io/scc}{"\n"}'
```

== (Optional) Performance Consideration
Measure startup time or simple CPU benchmark difference for awareness.

== Cleanup
```sh
oc delete project i9-sandbox --wait=false
```

== Key Points
- Kata adds VM boundary to container security model
- Still benefits from SCC, seccomp, quotas, NetworkPolicy
- Use selectively (higher overhead) for high-risk workloads
